At PyCon US 2019, several PyLadies organizers and other key stakeholders met to discuss the future of [PyLadies](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/blob/master/notes/2019/06_05_2019.md">minutes). After 10 years of existence, PyLadies had grown from a small collection of United States based chapters to a vibrant international community.

At the Future of Us workshop, participants discussed several topics including:

- organizational priorities
- resource management
- fundraising

However, the largest challenge the workshop identified was the need for a centralized leadership body. Thus the Global Council was born.

###  Planning for the future
