After a [public request for comment period](https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/11) in 2019, PyLadies created the current format for global PyLadies governance:

- A global council selected through a public election and application process
- Open source project teams open to all PyLadies members

### Council Membership

- The council will have 9 seats.
- 5 seats selected by public election, with a term of 2 years.
- 4 seats selected by application, with a term of 1 year.
- No one country of residence will account for more than 33% of the council during a cohort.
- There are no caps on terms.

The structure of the Council is subject to change based on recommendations and input from the PyLadies Global Council and the broader PyLadies community.

### Who is on the Council

The inaugural cohort will be selected through a public election and nomination process scheduled for June 2020.
