After a `public request for comment period <https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/issues/11>`_ in 2019, PyLadies created the current format for global PyLadies governance:

- A global council selected through a public election and application process
- Open source project teams open to all PyLadies members 

Council Membership
------------------

- The council will have 9 seats. 
- 5 seats selected by public election, with a term of 2 years.
- 4 seats selected by application, with a term of 1 year.
- No one country of residence will account for more than 33% of the council during a cohort.
- There are no caps on terms.

The structure of the Council is subject to change based on recommendations and input from the PyLadies Global Council and the broader PyLadies community.

Who is on the Council
---------------------

The inaugural cohort will be selected through a public election and nomination process scheduled for June 2020.
