At PyCon US 2019, several PyLadies organizers and other key stakeholders met to discuss the future of PyLadies (`minutes <https://github.com/pyladies/global-organizing/blob/master/notes/2019/06_05_2019.md>`_). This meeting was called to discuss several topics including, but not limited to: organizational priorities, resource management, and fundraising.

Overwhelmingly one of the largest takeaways from the workshop included the need to create a global leadership model to help PyLadies tackle these topics and continue to build for the future.
